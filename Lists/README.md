# BruteProxy.py default lists
BruteProxy come with some popular wordlists pre-installed. Of course, you can always use your own wordlist :)

### Setting it up
These wordlist behave the same as normal wordlist.

If you want to utilaze them, just set the `wordlist` parameter to `Lists/<name-from-here->`. For example:
```sh
BP.py> set wordlist Lists/rockyou.txt
```

## rockyou wordlist
**If you want to use popular rockyou wordlist, *please*, use rockyou that is in here. Other rockyou wordlists will *not* work, as they have a encoding problem and BruteProxy is not able to read them properly. Note that rockyou located here is exactly the same as normal rockyou, just has fixed encoding. Enjoy :)**
